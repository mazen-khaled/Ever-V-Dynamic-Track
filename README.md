# Our Vehicle Contain two essential ECUs: 
# ðŸ”‹ Battery ECU: 
- Measures battery capacity, voltage drop, and discharging current.
- Transmits data to the Gate ECU via UART.
- Drivers Used: ADC, TIMER, GPIO, UART.
- Hardware Used: ATmega32, shunt, voltage divider.

# ðŸš¦ Gate ECU:
- Measures vehicle speed, receives data from the Battery ECU, and Take Reading From all car switches.
- Displays data on the Nextion display using UART.
- Using Time trigger RTOS To handel data sending to the display.
- Drivers Used: UART 1 for Battery ECU and UART 5 For the screen, SYSTICK TIMER, GPIO
- Hardware Used: Tiva C, proximity sensor, Nextion display
